# SilentQuake-AI

SilentQuake-AI is a prototype system designed to analyze seismic-like signals and detect patterns associated with Silent Slip Events (SSEs). These subtle underground stress events may occur before major earthquakes, and identifying them early can help improve hazard assessment and research workflows.

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete AI-based seismic analysis workflow, which includes:
- Signal preprocessing
- Feature extraction
- Neural network training
- Prediction of SSE risk using a trained model

The system uses synthetic seismic-like data for demonstration and follows a modular structure to allow easy future expansion.

## Features
- Noise reduction and signal normalization
- Extraction of statistical and frequency-domain features
- Multi-layer neural network classifier
- Model saving and loading functions
- Clean, modular, and expandable code structure
